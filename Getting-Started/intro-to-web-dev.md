# Introduction to Modern Web Development

[<- Back](../README.md)

This document provides a brief introduction to modern web development, covering
the basics of how the web works, the different components of a web application,
and the various technologies used in web development.

## How the Web Works

The web is a network of computers that communicate with each other using a
standard protocol called HTTP. HTTP is a request-response protocol, where a
client sends a request to a server, and the server responds with a response.

A web browser is a client that sends HTTP requests to a server, and a web
server is a server that responds to HTTP requests from a client. When a user
enters a URL in a web browser, the browser sends an HTTP request to the server
specified by the URL, and the server responds with a response. The response
typically contains HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code that the browser renders to
display the web page.

## Components of a Web Application

A web application is a software application that runs on a web server and is
accessed by a web browser. A web application typically consists of the
following components:

- **Client-side code**: Code that runs on the client-side, i.e. in the web
    browser. This typically includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.

- **Server-side code**: Code that runs on the server-side, i.e. on the web
    server. This typically includes code written in a server-side programming
    language such as PHP, Python, Ruby, Java, or JavaScript.

- **Database**: A database is a software application that stores data in an
    organized manner. A web application typically uses a database to store data
    such as user information, product information, etc.

## Technologies Used in Web Development

The following are some of the most popular technologies used in web development:

- **HTML**: HTML is a markup language used to create web pages. HTML is used to
    define the structure of a web page, i.e. the elements that make up the web
    page and how they are organized.

- **CSS**: CSS is a style sheet language used to style web pages. CSS is used
    to define the appearance of a web page, i.e. the colors, fonts, layout, etc.

- **JavaScript**: JavaScript is a programming language used to add
    interactivity to web pages. JavaScript is used to define the behavior of a
    web page, i.e. how the web page responds to user actions such as clicking a
    button or entering text in a form.
