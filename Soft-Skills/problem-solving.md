# Tips on Effective Problem-Solving

[<- Back](../README.md)

Pólya's Problem-Solving Method is a four-step process designed by Hungarian
mathematician George Pólya. It's aimed at providing a structured approach to
tackling a wide range of problems. While it was initially developed for 
solving mathematical problems, it can be applied effectively in programming 
and other disciplines.

## The Four Steps

### Step 1: Understand the Problem

- **Read and Re-read**: Make sure you understand what is being asked, what 
    you already know, and what you need to find out.

- **Identify Key Terms**: Highlight or underline key terms, variables, and 
    conditions.

- **Clarify Ambiguities**: Don't hesitate to ask questions to understand the 
    problem better.

### Step 2: Devise a Plan

- **Strategy**: Decide on a method to solve the problem. It can be a 
    formula, algorithm, or a custom approach you design.

- **Break it Down**: If the problem is complex, break it into smaller, more 
    manageable sub-problems.

- **Sketch or Pseudo-code**: Sometimes visual aids like sketches or writing 
    pseudo-code can help clarify your plan.

### Step 3: Execute the Plan

- **Implement**: Based on your plan, write the code, perform the 
    calculations, or execute the steps you outlined.

- **Take Small Steps**: Don’t try to solve the problem in one go. Test each 
    step to make sure it's working before moving on to the next.

- **Debug**: If things aren’t going as planned, this is the time to 
    troubleshoot and make adjustments.

### Step 4: Review the Solution

- **Verify**: Double-check to make sure your solution meets the conditions 
    and solves the problem accurately.

- **Test**: Run through different test cases to ensure the solution works 
    universally and not just for a specific scenario.

- **Reflect**: Take a moment to understand how the solution works and how it 
    can be applied to similar problems in the future.

## Practical Application in Programming

- **Debugging**: When debugging, you can use these steps to systematically 
    isolate issues.

- **Algorithm Design**: The method is highly effective when designing 
    algorithms for solving specific tasks.

- **Code Reviews**: During code reviews, you can use this framework to 
    ensure that the solution is both effective and efficient.
