# Frontend Development Journey

Hi Earl. Love you, love love, love you! This is a quick guide to help you get
started with frontend development. You're super smart and capable of anything
you put your mind to, so you don't need this, but I hope you find it useful.

The best advice I have is to have fun and enjoy the process. You're going 
to be frustrated at times, but that's okay. It's all part of the learning 
process.

My second best advice is to track your notes in a similar git repository
as this one. Maybe even start by cloning this one and reorganize it to
your liking.
