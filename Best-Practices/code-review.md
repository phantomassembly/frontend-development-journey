# Best Practices for Code Review

[<- Back](../README.md)

Code reviews serve as a critical quality assurance measure in the software
development process. They offer developers an opportunity to scrutinize and
improve code quality, promote best practices, and share knowledge. This guide
aims to outline best practices for conducting code reviews.

## The Importance of Code Review

- **Quality Assurance**: Ensures that the code meets quality standards.
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Facilitates the exchange of knowledge and skills among team members.
- **Bug Identification**: Helps to catch bugs early, reducing the cost of fixing them later.
- **Coding Standards**: Promotes consistency in code by adhering to coding guidelines and best practices.

## General Guidelines

### For Reviewers

1. **Be Timely**: Aim to complete code reviews within a reasonable time frame
     to not block the progress of the contributor.
   
2. **Be Constructive**: Offer constructive criticism and suggest improvements.
     Avoid being overly critical without providing a solution.

3. **Focus on the Code, Not the Author**: Ensure that the review is impartial
     and focused on identifying code-level improvements.

4. **Ask Questions**: If something is not clear, ask the author for
     clarification rather than making assumptions.

### For Authors

1. **Provide Context**: When opening a pull request, provide enough context
     and documentation to help reviewers understand the changes.
  
2. **Keep Changes Small**: Smaller changes are easier to review and have a
     lower risk of introducing bugs.

3. **Respond Gracefully**: Accept feedback with an open mind and be willing
     to make necessary changes.

4. **Pre-Review**: Before asking for a review, self-review your changes for
     glaring issues.

## Code Review Checklist

1. **Logic and Functionality**: Does the code perform as expected?
2. **Coding Standards**: Does the code adhere to company and project coding guidelines?
3. **Comments and Documentation**: Is the code well-documented and are comments meaningful?
4. **Tests**: Are there sufficient automated tests and do they cover critical functionalities?
5. **Readability**: Is the code easily readable and does it make use of meaningful variable and function names?
6. **Error Handling**: Does the code gracefully handle potential errors and edge cases?
7. **Performance**: Are there any performance issues or inefficient code?
8. **Security**: Does the code expose any security vulnerabilities?
