# Readme-driven Development

[<- Back](../README.md)

Readme-Driven Development (RDD) is a software development methodology that
encourages developers to write the README document before writing any code.
The approach asserts that writing a quality README can drive the development
process by making developers think through the requirements, design, and
usability of the application beforehand.

## Importance of RDD

- **Clarity of Purpose**: RDD helps developers clarify the objectives and
    intended functionality of the software before diving into coding.

- **Early Feedback**: By writing a public-facing README early, you can gather
    input from stakeholders or potential users sooner.

- **Simplified Onboarding**: A well-documented README can serve as a valuable
    resource for new developers joining the project.

- **User Focus**: The approach encourages thinking from the perspective of
    the end-user, improving usability and design.

## How to Implement RDD

### Step 1: Define Objectives

Clearly outline the problem the software aims to solve. Who is the target
user? What are the main features?

### Step 2: Usage Examples

Include examples of how to use the software. This serves as a blueprint for
how you expect the user to interact with your application.

### Step 3: API Design

If applicable, describe the API endpoints or programming interfaces. This
will help to shape the code you need to write.

### Step 4: Implementation Details

This includes prerequisites, installation guidelines, how to set up the
environment, and any other technical details necessary for someone who wants
to contribute to the project.

### Step 5: Write Code

With a solid README in place, you can begin writing code that fulfills the
described objectives, use-cases, and API designs.

### Step 6: Update README

As the project evolves, be sure to keep the README updated to reflect changes
in how the software is used or how it works.

## Best Practices

- **Be Comprehensive**: Cover all aspects of your software, from installation to advanced features.
- **Be Clear**: Use plain language to ensure that your README is easily understandable.
- **Use Examples**: Providing examples can clarify complex points and show the user what to expect.
- **Versioning**: If your README describes a future state, mention that it's outlining a version thatâ€™s yet to be implemented.
