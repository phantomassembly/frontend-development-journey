# To-Do List App

[<- Back](../README.md)

## Introduction

Creating a To-Do List app is a great way to practice essential frontend
development skills like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this project, you'll
build a simple, yet feature-rich, To-Do List app that allows users to manage
their tasks effectively.

## Objectives

- Learn how to structure an application
- Practice DOM manipulation
- Gain experience with event handling
- Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations

## Technologies to Use

- HTML: For structuring the app
- CSS: For styling the app
- JavaScript: For handling user interactions

## Steps to Build the To-Do List App

### Step 1: Plan the UI/UX

Sketch out the User Interface, deciding on the essential elements like input
fields, buttons, and task lists. Think about the user experience, keeping it
simple and intuitive.

### Step 2: Setup Your Development Environment

- Code editor: Use Visual Studio Code or any other preferred editor.
- Version Control: Initialize a Git repository to keep track of your changes.

### Step 3: Create the HTML Structure

Build the HTML structure that will host your input fields, buttons, and task lists.

```html
<!-- Example Structure -->
<div id="todo-app">
  <input type="text" id="new-task" placeholder="New Task">
  <button id="add-task">Add</button>
  <ul id="task-list"></ul>
</div>
```

### Step 4: Style the App

Use CSS to style your app. Create a visually pleasing design but keep it simple.

```css
/* Example CSS */
#todo-app {
  width: 300px;
  margin: auto;
}
```

### Step 5: Add Functionality with JavaScript

Use JavaScript to add the following functionalities:

- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as complete
- Delete tasks
- Optionally, store tasks in local storage so they persist after the page is reloaded

```javascript
// Example JavaScript
document.getElementById('add-task').addEventListener('click', function() {
  // Your code here to add tasks
});
```

### Step 6: Test the App

Before you consider the project complete, make sure to test your app in
different browsers to check for any inconsistencies or errors.

## Optional Extensions

- Add the ability to edit tasks
- Implement task categories or tags
- Sort tasks by date or priority
- Use a frontend framework like React or Angular for a more dynamic experience
